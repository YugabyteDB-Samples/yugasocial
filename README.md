# YugaSocial

This project is a social media application built on ReactJS, Node.js and YugabyteDB (or optionally, MySQL). It is an extension of the sample app developed by [Lama Dev on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EuNnZEp2sQ), which can be found [here](https://github.com/safak/youtube2022/tree/social-app).

This full-featured application allows users to make posts, follow users, comment on posts, and more! Additional functionality will be included over time.

Interested in implementing a missing feature? Pull requests are welcomed!
